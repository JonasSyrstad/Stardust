Stardust.Nexus is a hobby project that has grown over the years. Frustrations over complex deployment procedures and configuration transforms lead to a centralized configuration store with versioning capabilities.

For most parts the project is developed in my spare time, and does have its fair share of minor bugs and ugly pages. But, IT works nicely from the system usage perspective, its just the UI that could use a proper web developer on the team.
